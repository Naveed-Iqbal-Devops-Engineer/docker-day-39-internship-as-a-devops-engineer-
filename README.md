Docker Fundamentals — Real Industry Example
🏭 Industry Scenario
You're a Cloud Administrator at a company named DevOpsMart. The development team asks you to set up and run a containerized Nginx web server using Docker. Your task is to pull the image from Docker Hub, run the container, manage it, and ensure it’s working as expected.
🧠 Objective:
This class aims to provide hands-on experience with Docker by guiding learners through the complete lifecycle of a containerized application—from installation to deployment and management—using a real-world example. It helps build foundational skills in containerization, Docker architecture, and image/container operations.

📌 Section 1: Docker Architecture (Theory + Diagram)


📖 Explanation:
Docker uses a client-server architecture:
Docker Engine: Complete platform installed on your Linux system to build and run containers.
Docker Client: CLI that communicates with Docker Daemon.
Docker CLI: Command-line tool that users run to interact with Docker via terminal.
Docker Daemon: Background service responsible for building, running, and managing containers.
Docker Image: Read-only template used to create containers.
Docker Container: Running instance of an image.
Docker Hub: Public registry to store and retrieve Docker images.
Docker Volume: Mechanism for persistent data storage outside the container filesystem.
Docker Networks: Virtual networks that allow containers to talk to each other and to the outside world.# docker-day-39-internship-as-a-devops-engineer-
